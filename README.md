# IRC Client Wrapper for irc.ppy.sh using the SIC irc command line utility

This looks like a very specific use case, and it *IS* a very specific use case.

This package needs the SIC command line utility in the path, it can be installed using ```sudo apt-get install sic``` or your favourite package manager.
